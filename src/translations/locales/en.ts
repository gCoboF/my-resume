      title: 'About me',
      description: 'I am a developer passionate about AIs, currently studying Computer Science at UFABC. I work as an intern in conversational technology at Fintalk S.A., where I develop agents in JavaScript and automations focused on solution architecture.\nMy passion for technology began at ETEC, where I had my first contact with the universe of front-end, back-end, and data science. Since then, I have been seeking to deepen my knowledge with personal projects, such as a RAG-based agent and this portfolio in React. Besides programming, I have always been fascinated by visual arts, one of my biggest hobbies along with sports. Drawing sharpened my eye for design and led me to create promotional arts in projects where I also worked as a developer.',

        paragraph1: "At Fintalk, a company focused on AI solutions, I worked directly on developing conversational flows for intelligent agents. I used JavaScript to structure dynamic dialogues and integrated with various APIs, ensuring that the bots met the specific needs of each client. To orchestrate and automate these flows, I worked with the n8n platform, which allowed me to create scalable and adaptable solutions for different service scenarios.",
        paragraph2: "In addition to development, I monitor agents using Datadog, tracking metrics, logs, and alerts to ensure the stability and performance of the delivered solutions. This proactive approach was essential to identify and resolve potential bottlenecks or failures before they impacted end users. I also participated in customer service, responding to incident tickets and collaborating for quick problem resolution, which gave me a broader view of the product lifecycle.",
        paragraph3: "My experience at Fintalk also involved an analytical approach to conversational flow data, looking for patterns and opportunities for continuous improvement. I had the opportunity to test internal software, acting almost as a QA, which expanded my understanding of quality, usability, and reliability of solutions. This multidisciplinary experience allowed me to develop technical and interpersonal skills essential for the conversational technology environment."
